According to protocol hierarchy we know the packet is encrypted and we have to decrypt it using the wireless password

After getting the password we will decrypt the wireless connection

After decrypting it we get this hierarchy

Here we will try to get the outer overview like whole conversation (traffic noise information)

now when we applied 1st one as filter we get TLS file which is mostly encrypted file

now checking the 2nd conversation  

![](/image/20240116022525.png)  

good news we have some traffic here so we will try to investigate it .  

According to `dport` connection details its `metasploit`

here i found that someone is using mimikatz and have exported `.pfx` file  

![](/image/20240116023430.png)  

  

![[exported.pfx]]  

  

this `.pfx` file is `base64 encoded` we have to `decode` it  

![[raw_exported.pfx]]![](/image/20240116024020.png)

  

now decoding the wireshark connection  

![](/image/20240116031350.png)

now you can see the protocol hierarchy  

![](/image/20240116031518.png)  

  

now what do we have to do ?  

we will export the data form rdp i guess (i have no idea how to but lets go)  

  

i will now export the `pdu's` (pocket data units layer 7) and save


----------------

Or you can use `Pyrdp` to play the rdp traffic into a video 


Tools used `wireshark` `aircrack-ng` `pyrdp(NOT_IN_ACTION)`

what do you learn form this room `wireshark skill(Recovering wifi password, Recovering Rdp certificate, Recovering file send using rdp)` `Recovering Rdp certificate form mimikatz` `aircrack-ng to crack wifi password`
